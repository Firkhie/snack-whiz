# Spice Pearls

## Ingredients

### Spice Mix
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Snack
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. **Make the Spice Mix** In a small bowl, combine the cumin, coriander, garam masala, cayenne, and salt. Stir to mix well and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Dough** In a medium bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour and water until a smooth, thick batter forms. Stir in the olive oil.

3. **Fry the Snacks** In a large skillet, heat 1-2 inches of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Scoop heaping teaspoons of the chickpea batter and carefully drop them into the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown. 

4. **Season and Serve** Transfer the fried chickpea bites to a paper towel-lined plate. While still warm, sprinkle generously with the prepared spice mix. Serve hot as a snack.
