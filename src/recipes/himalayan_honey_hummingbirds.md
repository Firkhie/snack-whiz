# Himalayan Honey Hummingbirds

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 1/2 cup Himalayan honey
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough:** In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, almond flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the Himalayan honey, melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.

2. **Chill the Dough:** Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the dough to firm up.

3. **Shape the Hummingbirds:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out small portions of the dough, about 1 tablespoon each, and roll them into bite-sized balls. Arrange the hummingbird-shaped dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart.

4. **Bake the Hummingbirds:** Bake the hummingbird snacks for 12-15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown. Be careful not to overbake, as the honey can cause them to brown quickly.

5. **Cool and Serve:** Remove the baked hummingbird snacks from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve the Himalayan Honey Hummingbirds as a delightful and unique snack, perfect for sharing with friends and family.
