# Balinese Bliss Bites

## Ingredients

### Coconut Filling
- 1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
- 1/4 cup coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons coconut sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

### Dough
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1/4 cup coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons coconut sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Zest of 1 lime

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Coconut Filling:** In a small bowl, combine the shredded coconut, coconut milk, coconut sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Mix well and set aside.

2. **Make the Dough:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, melted coconut oil, coconut milk, coconut sugar, baking powder, salt, and lime zest until a soft dough forms.

3. **Assemble the Bites:** Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

4. **Scoop a heaping teaspoon of the coconut filling and place it in the center of the dough. Gently fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pressing the edges to seal.** Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

5. **Place the assembled bites on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart.**

6. **Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until the dough is lightly golden. Allow the bites to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.**

7. **Serve the Balinese Bliss Bites at room temperature. Enjoy the tropical flavors and textures in every bite!**
