# Balinese Coconut Crunch

## Ingredients

### Coconut Mixture
- 2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
- 1/4 cup palm sugar, grated
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper

### Binding Mixture
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon lime juice

## Instructions

1. **Toasting the Coconut** Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Spread the shredded coconut evenly on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden brown. Allow the toasted coconut to cool completely.

2. **Mixing the Coconut Mixture** In a large bowl, combine the toasted coconut, palm sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, and white pepper. Stir until well mixed.

3. **Binding the Mixture** In a small saucepan, heat the coconut oil and honey over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Remove from heat and stir in the lime juice.

4. **Assembling the Crunch** Pour the binding mixture over the coconut mixture and stir until the coconut is evenly coated. 

5. **Baking the Crunch** Spread the coated coconut mixture evenly on the baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, stirring halfway, until the coconut is golden brown and fragrant.

6. **Cooling and Serving** Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the Balinese Coconut Crunch cool completely. Once cooled, break up any large clumps and transfer the crunch to an airtight container. Enjoy as a snack or sprinkle over yogurt, ice cream, or other desserts.
