# Moroccan Morsels

## Ingredients

### Pastry Dough
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
- 1/4 cup ice water

### Filling
- 1 pound ground lamb
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Make the Pastry Dough:** In a food processor, combine the flour and salt. Add the chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the ice water and pulse just until the dough begins to come together. Shape the dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Filling:** In a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground lamb, onion, and garlic until the lamb is browned and the onion is translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Drain any excess fat. Stir in the cumin, cinnamon, ginger, and cayenne. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped parsley. Allow the filling to cool slightly.

3. **Assemble the Morsels:** Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough out to 1/8-inch thickness. Use a 2-inch round cookie cutter to cut out circles from the dough. Place a heaping teaspoon of the lamb filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape and crimp the edges with a fork to seal.

4. **Bake the Morsels:** Arrange the filled morsels on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Serve warm.
