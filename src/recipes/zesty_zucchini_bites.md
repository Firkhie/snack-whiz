# Zesty Zucchini Bites

## Ingredients

### Zucchini Fritters
- 2 medium zucchini, grated
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

### Lemon-Garlic Dip
- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Zucchini Fritters** Grate the zucchini and squeeze out any excess moisture using a clean kitchen towel. In a bowl, combine the grated zucchini, beaten egg, flour, Parmesan, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well until fully incorporated.

2. **Cook the Fritters** Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a thin layer of oil. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the zucchini mixture and gently place them in the hot oil, flattening slightly. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Transfer the cooked fritters to a paper towel-lined plate.

3. **Make the Lemon-Garlic Dip** In a small bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, parsley, and salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

4. **Serve and Enjoy** Arrange the warm zucchini fritters on a serving plate and serve with the chilled lemon-garlic dip on the side. Enjoy as a tasty and healthy snack!
