# Spice Pops

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. **Popping the Corn** In a large pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the popcorn kernels, cover, and cook, shaking the pot occasionally, until the popping slows to 2-3 seconds between pops.

2. **Seasoning the Popcorn** Transfer the popped popcorn to a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix together the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne, and salt. Sprinkle the seasoning over the popcorn and toss to coat evenly.

3. **Serving** Serve the Spice Pops warm, or allow to cool completely before serving. Enjoy as a flavorful snack or movie-time treat.
