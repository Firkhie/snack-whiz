# Saffron Sunrise Snacks

## Ingredients

### Shortbread Dough
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Topping
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon rose water
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough** In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Stir in the cardamom and saffron. Gradually mix in the flour and salt until a dough forms. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Roll and Cut** Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. Use a 1-inch round cookie cutter to cut out rounds. Transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart.

3. **Bake and Finish** In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, rose water, and saffron. Sprinkle the saffron sugar mixture evenly over the cookie rounds. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
