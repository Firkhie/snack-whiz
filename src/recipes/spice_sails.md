# Spice Sails

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup warm water

### Spice Blend
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

## Instructions

1. **Make the Dough** In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the vegetable oil and warm water, and knead until a smooth dough forms. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Spice Blend** In a small bowl, mix together the cumin, coriander, cardamom, cayenne, cinnamon, and cloves.

3. **Roll and Cut** Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thickness. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into 2-inch triangles.

4. **Bake the Spice Sails** Arrange the dough triangles on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the spice blend evenly over the top. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy.

5. **Serve and Enjoy** Allow the Spice Sails to cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy this flavorful, aromatic snack on its own or with your favorite dipping sauce.
