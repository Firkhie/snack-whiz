# Spice Gems

## Ingredients

### Spice Blend
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Snack
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. **Make the Spice Blend** In a small bowl, combine the cumin, coriander, garam masala, cayenne, turmeric, and salt. Mix well and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Dough** In a food processor, pulse the flour and chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Slowly add the water and process until the dough just begins to come together. Shape the dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

3. **Assemble the Snacks** Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut the dough into small, bite-sized shapes using a cookie cutter or a sharp knife. Place the shapes on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart.

4. **Bake the Spice Gems** Brush the tops of the dough shapes with the beaten egg. Sprinkle the spice blend evenly over the tops. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the Spice Gems to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy these savory, spice-infused Spice Gems as a snack or serve them alongside your favorite dips or chutneys.
