# Moroccan Mint Melts

## Ingredients

### Cookies
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint leaves

### Spiced Sugar Coating
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom

## Instructions

1. **Make the Cookies** In a large bowl, beat the butter and powdered sugar together until light and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla and salt. Gradually add the flour and mint, mixing just until a dough forms. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Bake the Cookies** Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop the dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls. Place the balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.

3. **Bake and Coat** Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

4. **Make the Spiced Sugar Coating** In a shallow bowl, mix together the granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom. Working in batches, roll the cooled cookies in the spiced sugar to coat completely.

5. **Serve and Enjoy** The Moroccan Mint Melts are now ready to be served and enjoyed. Their delicate texture and aromatic flavors make them a delightful treat.
