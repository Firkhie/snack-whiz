# Tandoori Twists

## Ingredients

### Twists
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1/4 cup plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1/4 cup water

### Yogurt Dip
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon grated ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. **Make the Twists** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and garam masala. Add the yogurt, melted butter, and water, and mix until a smooth dough forms. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.

2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

3. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long, thin rope, about 1/4 inch thick. Twist each rope into a spiral shape and place on the prepared baking sheet.

4. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the twists are golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

5. **Make the Yogurt Dip** In a small bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, cumin, cayenne, and salt. Serve the tandoori twists with the yogurt dip on the side.
